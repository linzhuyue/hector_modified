# change log
## 1. modify to verify jumping motion planning and controller
## 2. using pinocchio replace all the kinenatic and dynamic parts
## 3. add the a general joystick controller without ros

## remark: if you wanna use joystick, you should firts press [RT+A] then [start], then you can control the robot

```

## System Requirements:
If you want to simulate with [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), we recommend **x86 platform**. **ARM platform** is not suggested for simulation. So, if you run this code on ARM platform, please remove *Simulation related* folder first.

The current system environment is: 

* Ubuntu 20.04 + ROS Noetic* (recommended, tested stable) 


## Configuration:
Use command to open .bashrc file:
* `gedit ~/.bashrc`

Make sure the following exist in your `~/.bashrc` file or export them in terminal. `noetic`, `gazebo-11` and `~/catkin_ws` should be replaced in your own case.
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source /usr/share/gazebo-11/setup.sh
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=~/catkin_ws:${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/catkin_ws/devel/lib:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/catkin_ws/devel/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

## Build:
* `cd ~/catkin_ws`
* `catkin_make`

NOTE: If it is the first time to compile, Please compile the laikago_msgs first by following command:
  
complie the package 
  * `catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`


### launch and run gazebo simulation:
* `roslaunch unitree_gazebo hector.launch`
The robot should be standing on the ground 

* In a new terminal, enter and source your workspace, then run: `rosrun hector_control hector_ctrl`

* Click the start button at the bottom of the simulator, the robot should stand up/move away
* In some occasions the controller does not kick in after starting, please terminate the controller with ctrl + \\. Then go back to the simulator, pause, and reset (ctrl + R). Rerun controller. 

## Keyboard Control: 
* Inside the terminal window, use W or S to control x direction speed
* Use A or D to control robot turning (TODO: seems to have a small bug when turning past 90 degrees)
* Use J or L to control y direction speed
